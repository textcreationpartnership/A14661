         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is it likely that God, who looketh forth of the heauens, and beholdeth all the ſonnes of men, Pſalm. 33.13. ſhould looke vpon them to no end, or behold them to no purpoſe? Surely no, he faſhioneth as well the wicked as the godly in the wombes of their parents: Eccleſ. 11.5. Hee gouerneth their words, Prou. 16.1. He appointeth out their

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19971:31"/>from bread. Wherein, if they meane, that God being the efficient principall cauſe of all things, doth preſerue and mooue that naturall force of working, which he gaue vnto them at their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that God vſeth the vertue of the fire to warme, and of bread to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, they thinke well: but if they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there is no vertue of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the bread, nor of warming in the fire, but that God being in the bread, and in the fire, warmeth and nouriſheth immediately by himſelfe, and by neither of them (as ſome haue fondly thought, and ſome more fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie written) their opinion is in no wiſe to bee approued. For not onely the Philoſopher (guided by meere rules of reaſon) but eſpecially the word of God, (a truth that neuer deceaueth) teacheth thus much vnto vs, that the Creator at the time of his creating of all things, gaue together with their life and being, a certaine naturall power and vertue of working: as the ſunne to expell darkeneſſe, the fire to yeeld a heate, liuing creatures to bee apt for procreation; and ſo in particular: Gen.

Now as God hath allotted to euery creature his proper place of abode, according to his nature and kind, ſo hee hath giuen to euery of them at their creation, a certaine power to worke, and vertue in working, according as their place and kind doth require.

Was it not a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of God in cauſing <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to dreame ſuch dreames,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 37.</note> in ſuffering his brethren to take occaſion thereby to ſlay him, in preuenting their purpoſe by the counſell of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in ſending the Iſhmaelites to whom they might ſell him, in mouing <hi>Potiphar</hi> chiefe ſteward of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> houſe to buy him:<note place="margin">Geneſ. 39.1.</note> and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being bought, in making him chiefe Ruler ouer <hi>Pharaohs</hi> houſe? Surely this was a worke of Gods wonderfull loue and exceeding mercie to his Church, accompliſhing that comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that in the time of dearth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall haue enough.

               <p>Therefore if the axe of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall vpon vs, if thou art afflicted in thy bodie, robbed of thy goods, toſt in thy paſſage, exiled thy countrie, hated of thy brethren, deliuered by God, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt fauour with the Prince, art aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to honour; in all theſe (being either fatherly corrections, to withdraw vs

               <p>A King that is Gouernour of a large and ample kingdome, doth not onely rule himſelfe, but hath alſo vnder him Counſellors, and Magiſtrates for the ſame purpoſe. Theſe are meanes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning which Princes muſt needes haue, becauſe one cannot ſee all abuſes, heare all cauſes, puniſh all offences: but with God, whoſe wiſedome and power is infinite, from whom nothing is hid, and vnto whom, to will and performe are both alike, there is no ſuch inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

Theſe with many other wee know that God in his gouernment hath effected; whence we conclude that hee is not ſo tied to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, as that when they faile, his Prouidence ceaſeth vnto vs: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he worketh without meanes, and ſometimes contrarie to their nature, for the declaration of his mightie power, and wonderfull goodneſſe. But it is to be obſerued, that when God worketh either of theſe two waies, hee vſeth an incomprehenſible and inniſible vertue of working, proper to his Deitie only: thereby teaching vs not to put any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in ſecond meanes, but euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they wholly faile, aſſuredly to hope for deliuerance from God, who at

Therefore, although Gods children are not curiouſly to fearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reaſons of their heauenly Fathers gouernment, yet the rules of godly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie being obſerued, we will enquire ſomewhat into them. <note place="margin">Reaſons of Gods working, ſometimes without, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times against meanes.</note> The firſt whereof may ſeeme to be this: that wee ſhould learne and know that hee doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies gouerne by meanes, becauſe hee cannot rule without them, but that hee will at his pleaſure manifeſt his infinite power ouer his creatures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great mercie to thoſe which loue and feare his name. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, whereas it is the nature of men, where they ſee no ordinarie meanes of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, there to attribute the euents vnto chance and fortune, the Lord therefore

               <p>But I will onely recite a few, and thoſe eſpecially which concerne Gods children. As the Law, the Goſpell, the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, the miniſterie of men, proſperitie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, good Angels, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly hoaſt, as the Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarres and ſuch like. The Law to be a ſchoolemaſter to leade vs to Chriſt. The Goſpell to worke a liuely faith, and true repentance. The Sacraments to ſtrengthen our faith, that we ſhould not backſlide. The miniſtrie of men, becauſe man by man may be mooued, but the voyce of God is terrible, and who may abide it? Proſperitie, that feeling how gratious the Lord is, we may be allured
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19971:40"/>to ſerue him who otherwiſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fed with the bread of affliction, would eaſily thinke that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to bee gratious.

Therefore ſometimes God wil let looſe Satan to trie thy faith: ſometimes ſet vp a tyrant to prooue thy patience: ſometimes depriue thee of his word in natiue countrie, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy loue vnto it bee ſo great, as that thou wilt ſell lands and liuing, to buy it in another.

So then his will is not altered, though his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not executed: becauſe with his Threatnings doth euermore goe the condition of repenting, alwaies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, though not euer expreſſed.

Euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needes bee diſſolued, becauſe their natures conſiſt of corruptible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and therefore they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies liue. Now this neceſſitie ariſeth from inward cauſes, whether it be from the forme, (as in the Sunne and the fire) or from that whereof they conſiſt, as in euery liuing creature. So a man not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19971:49"/>doth neceſſarily ſinne: but this neceſſitie doth not ariſe ſo much from any externall cauſe, as from his inward naturall corruption moouing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> A rebus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis.</note> a neceſſitie ariſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from externall cauſes: So the elect are ſaid to bee ſaued neceſſarily: but this proceeds not from any inward cauſe ariſing from themſelues, but from an externall cauſe, namely God, of the exceeding riches of his grace &amp; mercie freely electing them: vpon which, all other bleſſings and graces beſtowed, doe wholly depend. So likewiſe it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould die at the age whereat hee did die, neither could he liue any longer. Whence ariſeth this neceſſitie? Not from any inward cauſe in Chriſts nature: for in that reſpect hee was likely to liue long: but hence it was (as <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth) becauſe God of his determinate counſel and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had deliuered him,<note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> and therefore appointed the time of his death, and ſpeciall maner of the ſame. Of his time, Chriſt ſaith on this wiſe: <hi>My houre is not yet come:</hi> teaching vs that there was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19971:50"/>a certaine terme which could not bee exceeded. Of the manner he alſo ſaith: <hi>Behold, we go to Ieruſalem, and the Sonne of man ſhall be crucified.</hi> Thus the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of things doth ariſe ſometimes from cauſes externall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> A cauſis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis.</note> this neceſſitie doth ariſe, partly from internall cauſes, and partly from externall ioyntly conſidered. As in the Sunne and the fire (with infinite other) though the ſhining of the one and heate of the other are from internal cauſes, namely, their natures: yet both theſe effects come to paſſe by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and actuall power of continuall working, which are externall. And ſo in all other things in particular.</p>
               <p>But for the vnderſtanding of theſe things aright,<note place="margin">Cauſes are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther definit, or indefinite.</note> wee muſt know that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are either definite, or indefinite: and what is meant by either of them.</p>
               <p>Definite cauſes,<note place="margin">Cauſes definite</note> are cauſes ordained by God to worke certaine effects ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. In this ſenſe the Sunne is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to giue light, not ſo much by nature, (as Philoſophers ſay) but by the will of God (as Diuines ſay).<note place="margin">Cauſes indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Cauſes indefinit are ſuch as are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19971:50"/>to worke certaine effects, but haue it naturally in their power, either to worke or not to worke. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: It agreeth with the nature of man to write, yet that hee ſhould not write, doth not diſagree from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that (after that skill gotten) he may be ſaid to write, or not to write na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. Whence it is that the Sunne and the Moone (with ſuch like) are called neceſſarie cauſes of their effects: but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures (with others ſeruing to their vſe) are not neceſſarie, but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. But yet wee muſt vnderſtand, that cauſes are thus diſtinguiſhed in regard of their natures and vertue of working, giuen them by God in their creation: for if wee reſpect Gods euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and his diuine gouernment of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing in particular, then all cauſes are ordained to their certaine effects, and euery thing appointed to his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine end. <hi>Iudas</hi> was not of his owne nature ordained to betray Chriſt: for as he was naturally ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it lay in his power to doe it, or not to doe it. But if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Gods eternall will and counſell, then is hee truly ſaid to be a cauſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19971:51"/>for that purpoſe. And therefore that which <hi>Iudas</hi> did vnto Chriſt, was foretold long before by the Prophets of the Almightie: as <hi>Peter</hi> (in the Acts) plainly teacheth. <hi>Cyrus</hi> (in his owne nature conſidered) was not a definite cauſe of deliuering the Iewes: yet if you reſpect Gods eternall decree, hee was ordained (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith) for that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent end. Therefore in regard of Gods decree <hi>Cyrus</hi> deliuered the Iewes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, and <hi>Iudas</hi> betraied his maſter neceſſarily: yet neither by compulſion, but willingly and freely. For it is as hard for the will to bee forced, as it is impoſſible that it ſhould will contraries at one and the ſame time.<note place="margin">One and the ſame effect may be ſaid to be both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingent and neceſſarie.</note> Hence it is cuident, that one and the ſame effect may bee both contingent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</p>
               <p>Contingent, in reſpect of the nature and inward cauſes:<note place="margin">VVhy effects are called ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> neceſſarie, in regrad of Gods immutable decree, and Diuine Prouidence. Which neceſſitie is in two reſpects:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, becauſe the creature of it ſelfe, (being ſo ordained by God,) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but naturally yeeld ſuch an effect. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe efficient in al
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19971:51"/>things, hath determined in his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counſell, that ſo it ſhall worke.<note place="margin">An act not to be reclaimed.</note> As for example: the Sun doth ſhine of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold neceſſitie; the one, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is ſuch, that it cannot but ſhine (vnleſſe Gods ouer-ruling power doth hinder it,) the other, becauſe it is Gods wil, that in his ordinary courſe, it ſhould giue light vnto vs. There was a twofold neceſſitie that Chriſt ſhould riſe from the dead, and aſcend into heauen: the one, the will of God, the other, becauſe he was without ſin, and therefore could not be ſwallowed vp of the graue, nor detained by death. In which reſpects, (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) it was impoſſible hee ſhould be ouercome. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was committed freely, and by conſequence was contingent: for his nature was of that ſort, that he could either ſin, or not ſinne, either will a thing, or not will it, according as ſeemed good vnto him. If therefore you ſhall meerely reſpect <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> nature, then his ſinne was contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: but if Gods eternal counſell, and immutable will, then was his ſinne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, for God had decreed, that by his fall, (as thorow a pinching narrow
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19971:52"/>doore) we ſhould paſſe to receiue a certaine aſſurance in,<note place="margin">O foolix culpa, quae talem &amp; tantum habere meruit Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem.</note>&amp; through Chriſt Ieſus, of a farre more excellent eſtate of glorie. Chriſt died freely, Iſai. 53. He was offered, becauſe it was his will to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: Ioh. 10.11. <hi>I haue power to lay downe my life:</hi> yet if you reſpect Gods decree, Chriſt died neceſſarily, both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time, and manner of the ſame. It muſt needs be that Hieruſalem ſhould be deſtroyed by the Romanes; yet not ſimplie in regard of the citie, or matter whereof it did conſiſt, nor yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any neceſſitie in the perſons of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, for they freely beſieged it, and willingly ſubuerted it: and therefore it may be ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it lay in their power to ſpare it. But if you reſpect Gods eternal decree, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were neceſſary meanes of the ſubuerſion thereof, becauſe God (for their ſinnes) had ſo ordained it, as himſelfe had long before declared. Wherefore we conclude, that although Gods Prouidence doth impoſe a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie vpon all things, yet that it doth not take away their naturall working. And therefore in reſpect of God, all things are done neceſſarily: but in reſpect of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19971:52"/>ſecond Cauſes, ſome neceſſarily, and ſome contingently. Yet wee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that whereas ſome cauſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, ſome indefinite; ſome effects neceſſarie, ſome contingent, that this wholly proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods Prouidence: for he ordained them ſuch natures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them ſuch an order, &amp; appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their manner and ends of working. Therefore this neceſſitie doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this doctrine of Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but rather confirmes the ſame. This may ſuffice to proue this neceſſity; yet for confirming thereof, I will adde ſome reaſons:</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,<note place="margin">Reaſons to proue that Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence impoſeth a neceſſitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all things. Reaſ. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> by his certaine and infallible knowledge, thoſe things fall out neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily.</p>
               <p>But all things are thus foreknowne:</p>
               <p>Therefore all things fall out neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie.</p>
               <p>That it muſt needes bee,<note place="margin">Si praeſcierat Deus quod non est, praeſcientia iam non est. Aug. de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest. lib. <hi>1.15.</hi>
                  </note> that thoſe things fall out neceſſarily, which God hath certainly foreknowne, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe otherwiſe his knowledge ſhould bee deceiued, which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And that there is nothing which he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19971:53"/>hath not certainly foreknowne, it is likewiſe apparent: becauſe he is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing God, to whom all times are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and therefore the concluſion is good.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> The ſecond reaſon: All things are in all reſpects ſo effected, as God in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree and counſell hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:</p>
               <p>But Gods eternall decree and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, (appointing all things) are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable:</p>
               <p>And therefore all things fall out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily.</p>
               <p>Of the former part of this argument, there is no queſtion: becauſe if God ſhould not decree all things, he ſhould not be moſt wiſe: If not effect according to his decree,<note place="margin">Zanchius de Attrib. Dei. cap. <hi>4.</hi>

               <p>Of the conſequence, there can be no doubt, (as hath been prooued at large). And therefore the concluſion directlie followes.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon: Where all things are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19971:53"/>excellentlie diſpoſed and ordered, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> there all things fall out neceſſarily.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is Gods diſpoſing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all things:</p>
               <p>Therefore all things fall out neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie.</p>
               <p>That all things fall out neceſſarilie, where there is a perfect gouernment, it is plaine by reaſon, which teacheth, that if things ſhould come to paſſe by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as hauing a libertie of falling out, or of not falling out, then this order could not bee preſerued, becauſe (being not thus diſpoſed), they would as often fall out prepoſterouſlie, as directly.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is euident: Pſalm. 104.22. <hi>Thou Lord hast founded all things in great wiſdome.</hi> Now it is the propertie of wiſdome, to gouerne all things in a good order, and to direct them to a certaine ende, which being performed by God, in which reſpect he cannot bee the author of confuſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth: 1.

               <p>Then all things fall out neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:</p>
               <p>But both theſe are true:</p>
               <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">There is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, where there ſeemeth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test diſorder.</note> view the hiſtorie of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph:</hi> Contrarie to iuſtice, the righteous is puniſhed by the wicked: contrarie to nature, the death of a brother conſpired by his other brethren: contrarie both to the Law of God and nature, children doe agree to diſhonor God, and grieue the aged head and relenting heart of their father: herein are the rules of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie neglected, the Law of nature violated, the commandements of God reiected, then which, what more odious to men, what more puniſhed by God? And therfore in this there ſeemes more then diſorder.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 37.</note> Yet conſider the hiſtorie, and you ſhall find an excellent order in regard of God, though the fact moſt vile and wicked in reſpect of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren: Firſt, God caſt <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into two dreames, and gaue him the knowledge of reuealing their meaning. From the certaine declaration of them, ariſeth an hatred in his brethren towards him:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19971:54"/>this malice begetteth a determination of killing him: this determination is preuented by an aduice of caſting him into a pit: this purpoſe of his periſhing in the pit, is likewiſe preuented by the comming of the Iſmaelites at that verie inſtant: their comming giueth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of ſelling him: from his being ſold vnto them, ariſeth his paſſage into Egypt, and a ſecond ſelling him to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> chiefe Steward:<note place="margin">Geneſ. 39.1.</note> from his buying him, ariſeth a bleſſing vpon his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: from this bleſſing, a committing of all gouernment into his hand: from this Authoritie, an often recourſe into his miſtreſſe her preſence: from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, her beholding him: from her wanton gazing on his beautie, a wicked luſt: from this luſt, an impudent petition of ſleeping with him: from this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his deniall: from his deniall, her falſe accuſation: from this accuſation, his being caſt into priſon: this impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment is a meanes of reuealing his gift of expounding dreames: which brings him to the Kings preſence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his fauour, and makes poore <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ruler ouer his whole Kingdome.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19971:55"/>Now to the intent that we may ſee that this is no diſorder in Gods gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that of his infinit mercie and compaſſion vnto his Church, hee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the ſame; the famine being great and generall,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 41.57.</note> God did put it into <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> mind to ſend his ſonnes into Egypt for corne: where all things being at <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> diſpoſing,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 37.5.</note> (whereof good <hi>Iacob</hi> and his ſonnes neuer dreamed) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods purpoſe reuealed in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> dreame of the ſheaues, they doe homage vnto him,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 42.6.</note> are kindly vſed by him, who was moſt vilely intreated of them (a preſident of our wicked vſing of Chriſt, and of his gratious dealing with vs) and laſtly receiue corne ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their releefe, with other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his hands. Therefore, though in regard of the purpoſes of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this may ſeeme diſordered: yet in regard of the end purpoſed by God in exceeding mercie, and directed by his wonderful wiſdom, al came to paſſe excellentlie well: becauſe God ſent <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> before hand into Egypt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of his Church.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 45.5.</note> And therefore where things ſeeme vnto vs moſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19971:55"/>there God gouerneth excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond, namely,<note place="margin">That there is a neceſſitie in things ſeeming meere contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> that thoſe things are neceſſarie which ſeeme moſt contingent, it is in like maner eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15.14.15.</note> according to which prediction they came to paſſe in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>What ſeemes more contingent, then
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19971:56"/>that Chriſt ſhould bee carried into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt by reaſon of <hi>Herods</hi> perſecution, that hee ſhould be called from thence by the mouth of an Angell, that hee ſhould be betraied by one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that hee ſhould be ſold for thirtie peeces of ſiluer, that <hi>Peter</hi> before the third crowing of the cocke ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his Maſter, that the ſouldiers ſhould caſt lots for his veſture, that hee ſhould bee arraigned, condemned, crucified, dead, buried, riſe againe, and aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glorie? yet all theſe were foretold in Gods word, and came to paſſe (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) by the determinate counſell of God.<note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> And therefore were ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie. Laſtly, euen lotterie, where chance ſeemes to haue greateſt ſtroke, and reaſon and aduice leaſt to preuaile, and therefore is called of the Poets, <hi>Blinde lotterie, and vnlooked chance,</hi> euen this is ruled by Gods Prouidence: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs 16. <hi>The lot is cast into the lap, but the euent proceedes from the Lord.

In the election of a new Apoſtle, the Lot fell vnto <hi>Matthias,</hi> but not as hauing a libertie of falling vpon the other, for it was to ſhew that hee which knew al things (as the text ſaith) had choſen him.<note place="margin">Act. 1.24.</note> Therefore if theſe things ſeeming meere contingent, fall out neceſſarilie in reſpect of GOD, though vnto vs (to whom future euents are vnknowne) farre otherwiſe, how can wee denie the ſame neceſſitie in all other things, to which the like libertie is not granted?</p>
               <p>Further, it is to be obſerued, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though cauſes in their own natures not definite, may encline vnto either part, (as the will to chuſe or refuſe) yet theſe by Gods decree, encline to one part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: According to that of <hi>Salomon; Mans heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of waters, and whither he pleaſeth hee turneth the ſame:</hi> yet ſo, as that which

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond, as it is a puniſhment of ſins before committed: for God doth vſually puniſh one ſinne with another, Rom. 1.21. <hi>Becauſe when the Gentiles knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull, but became vaine in their thoughts, and their fooliſh hearts were full of darkneſſe, therefore the Lord gaue them vp vnto their hearts lusts, and vnto vncleanneſſe.</hi>

This guilt hath his ground in ſinne: Rom. 6.23. Death is the reward of ſinne: this death is from Gods Iuſtice, which willes that euery one ſhall haue his due: this death is our due, becauſe the ſoule that ſinnes, (by Gods law,) ſhall die the death: this law is giuen in equitie, for he hath the right of commanding, we of obeying, he our Creator, we his creatures, and therefore by the law of equitie and right of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, haue entred a ſtatute both of ſoules and bodies, to be obedient vnto him. Now all are guiltie, in as much s all haue ſinned: and this guilt is the bond, whereby in iuſtice we are tied through the committing of our ſinnes, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19971:61"/>the puniſhment they haue deſerued. And ſo is the third things conſidered in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe three,<note place="margin">God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the first thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſinne, viz. the Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> which is the Action: It is true that God is the principall Efficient, and Author thereof: <hi>for in him we liue, we mooue, and haue our being.</hi> Touching the third thing confidered in ſinne, namelie the guilt,<note place="margin">God is author of the third, namely, the Guilt.</note> whereby we ſtand bound to vndergoe the puniſhment our ſinnes haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, there is no queſtion, but that God doth in like manner will the ſame. But the ſecond, namelie the tranſgreſſing of Gods Law, which expelles the puritie in the action, and makes it wicked, breedes a doubt, whether God doth wil it or not. For the ſatisfying whereof, I will firſt ſhew, what it is to wil. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, how farre forth God doth will the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To will is taken two waies:<note place="margin">To will, taken two waies: <hi>1.</hi> Properly.</note> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or improperly: properly, when wee will a thing in reſpect of it ſelfe, becauſe we iudge it good indeede, or at leaſt, in appearance ſeemes to be ſo.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19971:61"/>of ſome good that will enſue the ſame and not in reſpect the thing we deſire, is of the one nature good. In which ſenſe, men doe often wiſh a naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. A man often deſireth the cutting offan infected member:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he doth not properly will the want of that member (for euery creature aimes at his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,) but the good he hopes will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame, namelie, the health of his bodie. So that there is an improper will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the one, becauſe we whollie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the other. So that the cutting away of that member, may rather be called a voluntarie permiſſion, then an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all willing, becauſe the will according to the owne nature willeth that which is good either in truth, or at leaſt in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: and if at any time it is carried to the contrarie, this commeth from a certaine diſturbing of the mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto none can ſay that God is ſubiect. Further, thoſe things which we proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie will, thoſe we like, loue, and take pleaſure in; but a knowne euill is neuer thus affected, and therefore at no time we properly deſire the ſame. Since this then is thus with men, much more is it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19971:62"/>ſo with God: Whence it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that hee doth willinglie ſuffer ſinne, and that he doth will that which followes the ſame, namelie, his owne glorie, but is no cauſe of ſinne, as it is ſimplie a tranſgreſſion of his law, as ſhal be more at large declared. But care is to be had, leſt in going about to ſet downe the meane, we fall into the extreame, or labouring to eſchew ſome danger, wee ſlip into a greater.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that he doth will ſinne as it is an action either inward or outward.</p>

                  <p>It is further to be obſerued in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of puniſhment, that God doth not will it as it is ſimply a deſtruction of his creatures, but as it is an execution of iuſtice and declaration of his glorie: for being a perfect goodneſſe, he would neuer inflict a naturall euill, vnleſſe it had reſpect to a morall good.

But ſinne is no other thing then a priuation and abſence of the good, neither (being conſidered only in it ſelfe) hath any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the nature of things.

As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: A man rather deſireth his ſonne ſhould applie his ſtudies, and ſo proue learned, then that hee ſhould be a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, delight in warrefare, or that baſer Arts ſhould be effected by him; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not fit for that thou deſireſt, when he entreateth thee that he may be a ſouldier, or to follow ſome occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou doſt yeeld vnto him; which kind of yeelding is called a ſuffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our willes. According to that old ſaying: When we cannot that which we would, then wee muſt that which wee can. But God willeth not after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for he is omnipotent, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19971:69"/>his will can neither be forced, nor reſtrained. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to permit, is often taken for a ſuffering of the one of two euils, that a greater euill ſhould not enſue. After this manner do Princes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in wiſdome ſuffer a traitour to reſt in his conſpiracy, that it may be the more euidently proued againſt him, and that other his complices may more apparently be knowne. As alſo, when they ſuffer the wickedneſſe of ſome to goe vnpuniſhed, leſt by cutting them off, the land ſhould bee weakened, or by ſome ſiniſter meanes the countrey brought to ruine. In which caſes, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not approue of the wickednes of their ſubiects, but in great wiſdome do ſuffer them a while, that by appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice they might ſuppreſſe them, or by vertuous lenitie, at length conforme them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third way of ſuffering, is when we do not preuent the euill which we could hinder, but do at our pleaſure ſuffer the ſame. As when by our skill in aduiſing, we could free a ſhip from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed vp of the ſeas; by our ſtrength, we could pluck our neighbour or his cattell forth of the ditch; by our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19971:69"/>abundance we could relieue the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cloath the naked, feed the hungrie, and ſuch like; yet in theſe caſes it is our purpoſe to yeeld no helpe at all, and therefore do willingly ſuffer them to periſh. After this manner doth God permit ſinne: and is excellent good in him, becauſe he is aboue the law, &amp; yet doth it to an excellent end, mixed with no maner of ataxie or diſorder at al: but is euill in vs, in regard we are vnder a law, which comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds we ſhould do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, as we would others ſhould do vnto vs. God ſeeth that man being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally euill, cannot but ſinne, vnleſſe he be preuented with the ſpecial aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit; he cannot but fall, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Pſalm. </seg>23</label> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſtaffe of his Spirit doth hold him vp. God knoweth this, and can by his al-ſufficient grace ſtay him vp; yet it pleaſeth him ſometimes to ſuffer him to ſinne, and to permit him (being of himſelfe not able to ſtand) ſometimes to fall, but this is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration and in wonderfull wiſdome: namely,<note place="margin">A threefold cauſe of Gods ſuffering of ſin: <hi>1.</hi> The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his iust iudgement:</note> either for the declaration of his iuſt iudgement, by puniſhing his ſinnes, or for the manifeſtation of the riches of his

                  <p>God hath left a certaine impreſſion of this his goodneſſe in his workes of creation. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that all things which God had made were very good.

And by how much the better it is, ſo much the more doth it participate vnto others: for thereby do men know and ſay that it is good. The Sunne is therefore more excellent then the reſt of the ſtarres, becauſe it is more beneficiall in extending his light and vertue. The like wee may ſee in other Gods creatures, and eſpecially in man: the more hee loueth, the more he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth the duties which loue requireth: the more righteous hee is, the more hee executeth iuſtice and iudgement: the wiſer hee is, the better hee diſpoſeth of ſeuerall matters: the more mercifull he is, the more he viſits the ſicke, feeds the hungrie, cloathes the naked, relieues the oppreſſed, and ſhewes compaſſion with cheerfulnes, and ſo in other things par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly: to which tendeth that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſaying of Chriſt: <hi>It is a better thing to giue then to receiue.</hi> Now if the

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Their third reaſon is taken from Gods abſolute perfection. There is nothing wanting in him, nothing to bee more deſired: therefore hee is perfect good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wee ſay that vertue makes the owner good, and his works good: for the vertue of euery thing, is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that thing: Therefore ſince God is abſolutelie perfect, it muſt needs follow, that hee is alſo perfectlie good. Neither is hee ſo fitly ſaid to bee good, as he is properly ſaid to be goodneſſe it ſelfe: that is, of himſelfe good, and of his owne eſſence perfect goodnes: for he receiues not his perfection from anie other: neither is it added to his diuine eſſence as an accident, for then it ſhould follow, that hee ſhould be good by the participation of another goodneſſe, which is impoſſible. Firſt, becauſe, if Gods eſſence and goodneſſe bee two
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19971:77"/>diſtinct things, then he ſhould not bee ſimple, but ſubiect to compoſition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, if he was not of himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie and eſſentiallie good, then hee ſhould be good by the participation of another goodneſſe, which is good of it ſelfe: and therefore ſhould not be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, becauſe hee ſhould haue another goodneſſe before him. For that thing which is good of it ſelfe, is in nature and order before that which it doth partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his goodneſſe vnto. But God is a moſt ſimple and eternall goodneſſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie perfect, and therefore of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe eſſentially good: ſo that this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection is proper to the Deitie only, in regard of which, al other things are meerely imperfect. The water made warme by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire, is imperfectly warme, becauſe it receiues heate from another: ſo the goodneſſe of all other creatures is imperfect, becauſe whatſoeuer ſparke of goodnes they haue, they receiue it from God.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19971:77"/>God, who is wiſdome and holineſſe it ſelfe. Yea, what is the righteouſneſſe of the moſt holie, and wiſedome of the moſt wiſe, being compared with God?

Touching the firſt, namely, that Gods foreknowledge cannot be the cauſe of ſinne:<note place="margin">God is ſaid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to know things, or to foreknow them.</note> we muſt note, that God is ſaid either to know things, or to foreknow them: betweene his knowledge &amp; foreknowledge, there is this difference.<note place="margin">The difference betweene Gods knowledge, and foreknowledge.</note> Knowledge is general of all things both done, and to be done; but his foreknowledge is reſtrained to things that are to be done hereafter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Gods knowledge extends to that within himſelfe, as well as to that without himſelfe; but his foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is onely of outward things, and cannot be ſaid to be of any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe: becauſe whatſoeuer is in God, is his eſſence, which being from euerlaſting, in reaſon he cannot be ſaid to foreknow the ſame.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:19971:81"/>
                  <p>We muſt further obſerue,<note place="margin">Knowledge is either contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue, or actiue.</note> that this his knowledge is to be conſidered two waies. The one abſolutely and ſimplie, as it is only in himſelfe; the other <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm quid,</hi> reſpectiuely, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer maketh that, whoſe maner &amp; forme he doth foreknow. The former is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue knowledge, that is, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without practiſe or effecting the thing foreknowne. The latter is an actiue knowledge, that is, a knowledge ioyned with practiſe, or a working the thing foreknowne.<note place="margin">Contemplatiue knovvledge no cauſe of ſinne.</note> Out of which diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, this Argument ariſeth: If Gods knowledge is the cauſe of ſinne, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it is contemplatiue, or actiue: But it is not a cauſe of ſinne either of theſe waies: And therefore not at all.</p>
                  <p>That Gods bare foreknowing a thing will come to paſſe,<note place="margin">Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot be a cauſe of ſin.</note> cannot be the cauſe of the thing foreknowne; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares: firſt, by the naturall signification of <hi>Theorica, contemplatiue,</hi> which is a meere conceiuing and vnderſtanding of a thing, without any working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thing, for then it ſhould ceaſe to bee contemplatiue, and ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come actiue. Secondly, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19971:81"/>as it is in it ſelfe conſidered, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ſaid to work any thing, for it is proper to the vnderſtanding to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cciue of thoſe things which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and it is peculiar to the will, to bee moued from the vnderſtanding, to the working of thoſe things, which the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding conceiueth. Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth belong to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and not to the will; therefore of it ſelfe cannot worke any thing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and if it worke nothing, it cannot be the cauſe of any thing, <hi>Cauſa enim eſt cuius vires est:</hi> For that is the cauſe of a thing, by whoſe force or vertue that thing is effected. The Phyſition knowes his patient will die ſhortly:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter knowes his neighbours houſe will fall quicklie: the Mariner knowes a leake not ſtopt in a paſſengers ſhip, will drowne him preſentlie. Is therfore the Phyſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſe of his patients death: the Carpenter the cauſe of the fall of his Neighbours houſe; or the Marriner the cauſe of the ſinking of the Paſſengers ſhip? Surely no: Therefore wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Gods foreknowing of ſins, cannot be a cauſe of them.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:19971:82"/>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gods actiue knovvledge cannot be a cauſe of ſinne.</note> actiue knowledge cannot be a cauſe of ſinne: for it is not ſimple, but is ioyned with the will: neither doth knowledge work vpon outward things, but the will onlie.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A Shipwright from his knowledge preſcribes the forme of a ſhip, and directs the way of making it: but his will going with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is actiue, and only worketh in the ſame: becauſe it is from his will that he worketh himſelfe, and from thence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that hee commandeth others; for a man doth not make a ſhip, becauſe hee knowes the way of framing it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſires and willes a ſhip, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he labours to haue it. Indeed with God there is neither time paſt nor to come, yet by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> order which we ſee he hath ſet downe in the courſe of things, which is vſually called a naturall order, we may ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knowledge goeth before the wil, and the wil before the effecting of the worke; for we worke nothing but that which we firſt will, neither will wee any thing properlie, but that which our vnderſtanding doth firſt conceiue, and our iudgement approoue. Now I hold it lawfull by the conſideration of this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19971:82"/>naturall courſe infuſed into the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Though not ſtrictly in all, yet in this vve now entreats of.</note> to aſcend vnto the knowledge of the diuine order of working in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo in humilitie to reaſon from things naturall to ſupernaturall. And this ſeemes <hi>Paul</hi> to warrant, when hee ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>The inuiſible things of God, that is, his eternall power and his Godhead, are ſeene by the creation of the world:</hi> the heauens declaring the glorie of God, and the earth ſhewing his handiworke. Therfore it is certaine that Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not a cauſe of any thing, but that his knowledge and wil conioyned, effect all things. Wherefore wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this truth with <hi>Augustine:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> 
                     <hi>Deus nos peccatores pranoſcit, non facit: God foreknowes we will ſinne, but makes vs not ſinne:</hi> according to that of <hi>Hierome: Non ideò peccauit Adamus quia Deus hoc futurum nouerat, ſedpraeſciuit Deus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dial. <hi>3.</hi> aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Pelag.</note>
                     <hi>quaſi deus, quidille erat propria voluntate facturus: Adam did not therefore ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Godknew hee would ſinne: but God, as he was God, did know what Adam of his owne will and accord was about to do.</hi> And thus much for the proouing that Gods knowledge cannot properly bee the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19971:83"/>cauſe of any thing. I come to the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Before I enter the prouing that Gods decree cannot be the cauſe of ſinne,<note place="margin">Gods decree is not a cauſe of ſinne.</note> we muſt obſerue that it is to be conſidered two waies:<note place="margin">Gods decree conſidered two waies.</note> Firſt, as it is in himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all beginnings, not manifeſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any: ſecondly, as it is put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo made apparent to others. The former is called an Act of decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within himſelfe, the latter, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this decree effected without himſelfe.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> The firſt is that whereby God hath neceſſarilie, yet freelie from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie decreed all things: the ſecond is an Action of God, by which al things in their appointed time are ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as in his heauenly wiſdome, they were foreknowne and in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell decreed. Now Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree conſidered either of theſe waies, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be an abſolute cauſe of any actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only ſo far forth as God hath willed that action. True it is, that God willeth not any thing but that which in great wiſdome he had decreed: yet he cannot ſo properlie be ſaid to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of any thing in that he decreed it, as in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19971:83"/>that he willed it, becauſe his will effecteth what his decree appointeth: whence this argument ariſeth:</p>
                  <p>If Gods will is not a cauſe of any ſinne, then much leſſe his decree:</p>
                  <p>But Gods will is not at any time a cauſe of ſinne:</p>
                  <p>And therefore not his decree.</p>
                  <p>Of the propoſition there is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Gods vvill is not a cauſe of ſinne.</note> It reſteth to prooue the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: being the third and laſt part of the diſiunction.</p>
                  <p>The will of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 8.19. Epheſ. 1.</hi> Gods vvill is either efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, commanding, or permiſſiue.</note> being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he moſt freely and powerfully wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things, and that with one and the ſame Act of willing, is diſtinguiſhed into efficient, commanding, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiue.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Efficient.</note> His efficient will is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee either worketh abſolutelie of himſelfe without the meanes of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or if by others, yet ſo as that they doe not properlie worke, but God in and by them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.</note> His commanding will is that, whereby he worketh by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſetting of others to worke.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Permiſſiue.</note> His permiſſiue will is that whereby he doth willinglie ſuffer ſin to bee committed for the manifeſtation of his iuſtice and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19971:84"/>glorie. The two former waies doe ſo comprehend Gods working, as that (the thing being effected according to the manner and end preſcribed,) he is made the principall cauſe and author thereof. But his latter way of willing, namely, his voluntarie ſuffering, can by no meanes make him the cauſe of the euill he doth ſo permit. But all is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after this manner:</p>
                  <p>If Gods will is the cauſe of any ſinne, then it is either as he doth effect it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, command others to commit it, or becauſe he doth willinglie ſuffer it:</p>
                  <p>But Gods will is not a cauſe of ſinne any of theſe waies:</p>
                  <p>And therefore not at all.</p>
                  <p>Touching the former two, becauſe from a cauſe ſimplie good cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any euill, neither can he which is Iuſtice it ſelfe, puniſh that in another which hee commandeth that partie to commit; by reaſon of theſe and many moe alreadie alleaged, there is no doubt to be made of them. The queſtion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the third, namely Gods voluntary ſuffering of ſin, which although I haue prooued that it cannot be a cauſe of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19971:84"/>thing ſo ſuffered; yet becauſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of this truth doe draw moſt of their arguments from hence, Satan cunningly raiſing many doubts of his goodnes, who indeed is an infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in, and of himſelfe, and is alſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitelie good and gratious vnto others, I will by way of confirming the latter part of this Argument, ſtand ſomewhat more vpon opening this truth vnto vs. What Gods permiſſiue will is, I haue ſhewed immediatelie before. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from which it proceeds is his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as that from which all his actions, (<hi>quoad extra,</hi> as Diuines call them) which are effected without him, haue their beginning: and is thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, either it is abſolute and ſimple,<note place="margin">Permiſſion is either ſimple or respectiue.</note> as the ſuffering of <hi>Adam</hi> to eate the forbidden fruit, or it is reſpectiue and hath regard and conſideration to the parties ſuffered. God determining thereby to keepe his law of iuſtice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, and yet to giue a generall rule to all Magiſtrates how to vſe a wiſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. As when God permitted the Iſraelites to ſell their children into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and <hi>Moſes</hi> for the hardneſſe of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19971:85"/>the peoples hearts granted a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.8.</note> though from the beginning it was not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Touching this permiſſion thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,<note place="margin">Jn God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſin, foure things to be obſerued.</note> theſe things are to be obſerued: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that Gods ſuffering of ſinne is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie: for being almightie, he cannot be conſtrained to any thing. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that this ſuffering, is for a ſet purpoſe and end agreeing with his iuſtice and glorie: as that the exceeding riches of his grace and mercie might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in ſauing the elect, and his iuſtice and power be more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wicked. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is not idle, proceeding either of negligence, inabilitie, or ignorance, (common cauſes of mans permitting) but is from the determinate counſell of God, knowing, and decreeing a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie ſuffering. Laſtly, that this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is with a limitation of the natures of ſins, of their number, with the times, places and perſons committing them. So that men are often reſtrained in their wicked purpoſes, neither can the diuell preuaile alwaies in what he moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, no not with the moſt wicked,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19971:85"/>much leſſe with the vnregenerate in the ſecret counſell of God elected to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie, though not as yet called home to Chriſt Ieſus the Shepheard of the flocke and Biſhop of our ſoules. For if Gods diuine power and rich grace, ſhould not concurre in this, then (alas) men ſhould neuer ceaſe ſinning, yea then their leaſt tranſgreſſions ſhould be <hi>peccata clamantia,</hi> crying ſinnes, ſinnes of preſumption, blaſphemies &amp; ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt; that ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters might periſh finally. Whereto then ſhould ſerue the gratious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Chriſt Ieſus vpon true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by a liuely faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Alas to no end:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.3.</note> for without the barres of Gods grace and mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, wee inclining, the world alluring, and Satan continually tempting; how ſhould we eſchew that great &amp; ſeareful ſinne, for which the grace of repentance is neuer granted? If this was not true euen in the wicked, moſt lamentable miſerie ſhould befall all true hearted Chriſtians. We haue experience of the truth of this doctrine in the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſecutions of the Church of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19971:86"/>Chriſt, and eſpecially in that moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſpiracie and infernall treaſon, deuiſed, plotted, and proſecuted by that Antichriſtian ſect and diuell incarriate Papiſts, againſt the Church of Chriſt, his chieſe Anointed, and all other the moſt religious, wiſe, and honourable Peeres of this Common-wealth, whom, had not the hand of the Lord (of his eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace to the Nurſefathers of his Church) miraculouſly deliuered, they, (curſed be the ſoules that ſhall once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it) as innocent lambes had been deliuered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloodie ſlaughter-houſe of diuelliſh Tyrants, the walles of our Hieruſalem had been broken downe, the honour of our Sion laid in the duſt, yea, the many Pillars and ſole Maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our welfare being taken away, (farre be it from vs O Lord: for this is moſt fearefull to thinke of, how fearfull then O Lord to endure it?) we thewhole bodies of his Highnes dominions had come to a moſt lamentable ſubuerſion and ouerthrow.<note place="margin">A comfortable instance of Gods reslray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſinnes of the wicked.</note> But (to the euerlaſting praiſe of our moſt gratious God bee it ſpoken) they haue digged a pit, and haue fallen into the middeſt of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19971:86"/>the Lord of the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath broken their nets, &amp; our ſoules are deliuered from the bloodie hands of theſe infernall, inſatiate fowlers.

                  <p>Further,<note place="margin">In euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</note> it is to bee obſerued, that in euery permiſſion there are two Agents:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19971:87"/>the perſon permitting, and the perſon permitted. The former hath power to hinder, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaſeth doth vſe the ſame. The latter hath an abilitie of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and when hee is permitted, doth put the ſame in execution. In both of theſe there is a voluntarie action, as wel in the ſuffered, as in the ſuffer: but herein is the difference, the action of his will which ſuffereth is only inward, and worketh nothing in him whom it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth: the partie ſuffered worketh of his owne proper will, his end of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king being not preuented, nor his meanes of accompliſhing hindred by the other: ſo that although in both of theſe there is a voluntarie action, yet one of them onely is author of the fact: And by conſequence, God onely ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and we wholly executing, hee is moſt pure and holy, and we only guiltie of our ſinnes committed.

It is a good end to purpoſe the hearing of Gods word, to be therby taught our dutie: but to ſteale a horſe to ride to heare it, makes the action euill, becauſe thou ſinneſt in the meanes. The faſting, giuing almes, and long ſupplications of the Scribes and Phariſies, ſeemed to bee good actions, (for ſuch duties are both ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and largely commended): but becauſe they were done of vaine oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to be ſeene of men, they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the end, and ſo made the whole action euill.

                  <p>Firſt therefore, it is anſwered: that there is no confuſion nor diſorder in theſe things: for the confuſion is onlie in reſpect of man, and not of God, or the things gouerned by him, which are euermore excellently well diſpoſed, though (the vaile of ignorance being before ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eies) we are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne this excellent order.

For as the bodies, ſo the ſoules of men and women haue

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third conſideration which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this miſerie, is, that no feares can procure releaſe, nor any time ſhorten the bondage: preſent afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ſhort light, and profitable; but the future torments prepared for the vnrepentant, are euerlaſting, heauie and vnprofitable: let them weepe as many teares as there are drops of water in the maine Ocean, and continue weeping ſo many yeeres as this Ocean will afford drops, yet all is in vaine, the puniſhments are not miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, nor the time ſhortned.<note place="margin">Ierem. 8.</note> The ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is paſt, the harueſt inned, the wheat placed in the garner of glorie, and the chaffe committed to the flame of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire.

Now if it be an omitting of the meanes to haue a price in our hands to buy them, and not to haue the hearts to disburſe it, whether our ſeeking of occaſions to be abſent from the word &amp; bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whether our backwardneſſe to come when wee are ſo often inuited, whether our ſmall regard in hearing, and leſſe in practiſing, be an omiſſion or a contempt, I leaue to God and mens conſciences to determine: only this I am ſure, it is too nice a diſtinction to ſtand vpon in matters of ſaluation: the failing in the one, is a ſigne of falling
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:19971:180"/>into the other; and in thee that art not able to anſwere an idle thought, it will bee Chriſtian wiſedome to preuent ſo vile a deede. But let theſe men remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſince the Law leades vs to Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Gospell is the povver of God to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and the Goſpell begets faith and repentance, comforts vs in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, humbles vs in proſperitie, declares Gods loue vnto vs, ſhewes how wee ſhould loue him, reueales his power, our weakneſſe, his wiſedome, our folly, his grace, our naturall miſerie, enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our dark vnderſtandings, informes our iudgements, confirmes our faith, reformes our lines; that therefore theſe bleſſed meanes with others ordained in them, are ſole declarers of the way to happineſſe, excite vs to walke in it, who otherwiſe would not enter it, and being entred, doe keepe vs in the ſame. And therefore as the man that deſireth to be at a citie, ſhall neuer come at it, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte the waies leading to the ſame: ſo many fooles wiſhing after many daies ſpent in the luſts of their fleſh, to bee at new Ieruſalem, and yet all their life time reiected the waies that God appointed for the leading vnto it, will rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19971:181"/>in what they deſire, then haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſurance of their comming thither. Therefore howſoeuer the wicked and fooliſh deſire to die the death of the righteous, and at laſt to be partakers of their bleſſedneſſe, and yet reiect the meanes whereby they ſhould attaine it, (like men that deſire their health, and yet are neuer well but when they fall into ſurfets) yet let the righteous haue theſe bleſſed meanes euermore in high eſtimation, let them be ſweeter to them then the honey and honey combe, for by them Gods ſeruants are taught, and in keeping them there is great reward.</p>
